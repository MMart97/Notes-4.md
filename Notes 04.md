## Keypoints:
  - Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
  - (Hacker, attacker, intruder) people who seek to exploit weaknesses in software and computer systems for their own gain
  - Malicious code (malware) is unwanted files or programs that can cause harm to a computer or compromise data stored on a computer (viruses, worms, and Trojan horses)
  - Vulnerabilities are flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions in a system
  - AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud (hardware, software, network infrastructure)
  - The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS
  - Authorization is the process of determining what permissions a user, service or application should be granted
  - An IAM user is a person or application that is defined in an AWS account, and that must make API calls to AWS products
  - An IAM group is a collection of IAM users
  - An IAM policy is a document that defines permissions to determine what users can do in the AWS account
  - An IAM role is a tool for granting temporary access to specific AWS resources in an AWS account
  - AWS Organizations is an account management service that helps you centrally govern your environment as you grow and scale your workloads on AWS
  - Data at rest is any information that is stored on a disk, tape or any medium in which it is not moving from system to system
  - Data in Transit refers to any data that is moving across a network
  - AWS Cloud Compliance enables you to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and data protection in the cloud in order to achieve compliance with your solutions
  - DevSecOps (everyone is responsible for their own security)
   
   
  # Quote 1: " There is no guarantee that even with the best precautions some of these things won't happen to you"
    - This quote is interesting because it explains how hackers are always expanding on ways to infiltrate people's personal info thus increasing the need for cybersecurity
    
  # Quote 2: " Careful consideration must be taken when protecting data as it is often worth more than the hardware it is stored on"
    - This interests me becuase the cost of protecting data is considerably higher than the cost of protecting hardware
    
  
  ## New Facts:
    - Install software patches so that attackers cannot take advantage of known problems or vulnerabilities
    - A reputable antivirus software application is an important protective measure against known malicious threats
    - Select passwords that will be difficult for attackers to guess, and use different passwords for different programs and devices
    - Authentication is a process used to validate a userâ€™s identity
    - Firewalls may be able to prevent some types of attack vectors by blocking malicious traffic before it can enter a computer system, and by restricting unnecessary outbound communications
    - Phishing emails are currently one of the most prevalent risks to the average user
    - Inherited Controls (Controls which a customer fully inherits from AWS)
    - Shared Controls (Controls which apply to both the infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in completely separate contexts or perspectives)
    - Customer Specific (Controls which are solely the responsibility of the customer based on the application they are deploying within AWS services)
    - The scope of the IAM service configurations is global
    - The principle of least privilege promotes that you grant only the minimal user privileges needed to the user, based on the needs of your users
    
    
   ## Remaining Questions:
    - Why should you avoid using a root account for IAM
